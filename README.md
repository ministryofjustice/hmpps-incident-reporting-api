This application is the REST api and database that owns incident report data for prisons.

## Running locally against dev/T3 services

This is straight-forward as authentication is delegated down to the calling services in `dev` environment.

Use all environment variables starting with `API_BASE_URL_` from [helm chart values](./helm_deploy/values-dev.yaml).
Choose a suitable hmpps-auth oauth client, for instance from kubernetes `hmpps-incentives-api` secret and add
`INCIDENT_REPORTING_API_CLIENT_ID` and `INCIDENT_REPORTING_API_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Start the database and other required services via docker-compose with:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

Then run the API; for example using IntelliJ.

## Testing and linting

Run unit and integration tests with:

```shell
./gradlew test
```

Run automatic lint fixes:

```shell
./gradlew ktlintformat
```

## Connecting to AWS resources from a local port

There are custom gradle tasks that make it easier to connect to AWS resources (RDS and ElastiCache Redis)
in Cloud Platform from a local port:

```shell
./gradlew portForwardRDS
# and
./gradlew portForwardRedis
```

These could be useful to, for instance, clear out a development database or edit data live.

They require `kubectl` to already be set up to access the kubernetes cluster;
essentially these tasks are just convenience wrappers.

Both accept the `--environment` argument to select between `dev`, `preprod` and `prod` namespaces
or prompt for user input when run.

Both also accept the `--port` argument to choose a different local port, other than the resource’s default.
